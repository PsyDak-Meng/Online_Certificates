This will make a 1 bedroom house cost 100k, a 2 bedroom house cost 150k etc.\n","\n","How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.\n","\n","Hint: Your network might work better if you scale the house price down. You don't have to give the answer 400...it might be better to create something that predicts the number 4, and then your answer is in the 'hundreds of thousands' etc."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"PUNO2E6SeURH","tags":["graded"],"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690007551713,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":9129,"user":{"displayName":"Che-Ting Meng","userId":"01832823181779290658"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"metadata":{"id":"B-74xrKrBqGJ","tags":["graded"],"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690008420148,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Che-Ting Meng","userId":"01832823181779290658"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# GRADED FUNCTION: house_model\n","def house_model():\n","    ### START CODE HERE\n","\n","    # Define input and output tensors with the values for houses with 1 up to 6 bedrooms\n","    # Hint: Remember to explictly set the dtype as float\n","    xs = np.array([1.0,  2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=float)\n","    ys = np.array(list(map(lambda x: (0.5+x/2),xs)), dtype=float)\n","\n","    # Define your model (should be a model with 1 dense layer and 1 unit)\n","    model = tf.keras.Sequential(tf.keras.layers.Dense(input_shape=[1],units=1))\n","\n","    # Compile your model\n","    # Set the optimizer to Stochastic Gradient Descent\n","    # and use Mean Squared Error as the loss function\n","    model.compile(optimizer='sgd',loss='mean_squared_error')\n","\n","    # Train your model for 1000 epochs by feeding the i/o tensors\n","    model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)\n","\n","    ### END CODE HERE\n","    return model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FbdILtLdTDdg"},"source":["Now that you have a function that returns a compiled and trained model when invoked, use it to get the model to predict the price of houses:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{"tags":["graded"],"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FLruxJ4cTDdg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690008430530,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":10075,"user":{"displayName":"Che-Ting Meng","userId":"01832823181779290658"}},"outputId":"cb57063f-f03f-486a-9a90-25b2bbf4e50d"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Epoch 1/500\n","1/1 [==============================] -
